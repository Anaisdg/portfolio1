        <p class="scary_plot_description"> The game SET is a popular card game that was invented by Population Geneticist, Marsha Jean Falco, who was trying to understand if German Shepherds who get epilepsy inherit it. The game evolved out of a coding system that she used in her job to
          answer her question about inheritance.
          <br> The object of the card game SET is to identify a 'set' of three cards from 12 cards laid out on the table. Each card has a variation of the following four features:
          <br>
          <strong> (A) Color: </strong> Each card is red, green, or purple.
          <br>
          <strong> (B) Symbol: </strong> Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.
          <br>
          <strong> (C) Number:  </strong> Each card has one, two, or three symbols.
          <br>
          <strong> (D) Shading: </strong> Each card is filled, empty, or striped.
          <br>
          <br> A SET consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on each card OR is different on each card. That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on each card.

        <p class="scary_plot_description"> For example, the following is a SET because all three cards are <strong>same</strong> color (red); all are the <strong>same</strong> shape (ovals); all have the <strong>same</strong> number of symbols (two); and all have <strong>different</strong> shadings (filled, empty, striped):

        <p class="scary_plot_description"> If you've ever played the game, you know its not easy. Here's an example of picture of the board that a user might input. In this exammple, there are 5 sets total. Can you find them all? Can't find any? You're not alone. This game is played in with group, but often times all the players can't find <strong> a SINGLE SET </strong>.

        <p class="scary_plot_description"> Turns out, that's because humans aren't really that good at finding SETs. There are 81 unique cards in this game, which yields 1080 unique SETs. The odds against there being no SET in 12 cards when playing a game of SET start off at 30:1 for the first round. Then they quickly fall, and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 and for the next 20 rounds they slowly fall towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1. The odds against there being no SET in 15 cards when playing a game are 88:1.
          <br>
          To help you and your friends find the SET that probably exists and prevent you from pulling your hair out, my team and I made a web appication that allows you to upload a picture of your board and finds the SETs for you!

          How it works:
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong> Image Uplaod:</strong> The user takes an uplaods a piture of their board.
          <br>
          <strong> Card Identification & Image Segmentation: </strong> With OpenCV, the contours of the edge of the cards are detected, the cards are cropped (image segmentation), and temporarily stored in a directory.
          <br>
          <strong> Card Prediction and Prediction Decoding:  </strong> The color of the shapes in the cropped cards are identified using OpenCV. The cropped card is then run through a Keras model which predicts which class the card belongs to. The model we made has 92% accuracy for categorical classification. After the prediction is made, a decoder asigns the appropriate label which contains information on the rest of the card features (shape, number of symbols, and shading)
          <br>
          <strong> Game Logic: </strong> Once all of the card labels have been collected, they are sent through the game logic which outputs a list of SETs.
          <br>
          <strong> API Call & Display:</strong> This list is used to retrieve pictues of the cards that are in the players SETs from a custom API. Finally, the SETs are displayed to the user, and the user finds peace.

           This game, although seemingly simple, came with its fair load of challenges. Unfortunately, our Keras model, even at 92% accuracy, isn't working well enough for us. We won't deploy the app until we can get 98% accuracy -- the accuracy we got for a proof of concept 12 card classifier. Take a look at the blog (link at the top of this page) to learn about the different approaches we took to solving this problem, the challenges we're facing, and the next steps we're taking!
